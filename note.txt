Look at the response for the GET in api/categories 
it retunrs a JSON value like this
{
        "id": 103,
        "name": "Fisheries",
        "products": []
    }

"products" :[] array is meaning full but not necessary to here. we can't obviously change the Model because then EF will throw errors and we are breaking our domain design.
Instead we create resource classes to each endpoint,for what we want to expose using the endpoint.

A resource class is a class that contains only basic information that will be exchanged between client applications and API endpoints, 
generally in form of JSON data, to represent some particular information.

All responses from API endpoints must return a resource.

after creating the relevent resource classes we are going to map them service objects by  a lib called AutoMapper.

'   dotnet add package AutoMapper
    dotnet add package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection      '

once you have added the dependency you wil have to register it for dependency injection and then create a class that will tell AutoMapper how to handle classes mapping

after changing the Startup.cs and the creating to ModelToResourceProfile.cs we could use the mapping by changing the controller class
